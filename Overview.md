<b> Summary </b> 

Crosswalk Visualizer is an <b>exploratory data analysis</b> tool that is designed to assist leaders with training management planning by providing the following outputs:

<ul>

<li> Interactive graph visualizations to facilitate an understanding of task relationships</li>

<li> Prioritization metrics (payoff / complexity) to facilitate an effective commander's dialogue when selecting tasks to be included in a Unit Training Plan</li>

<li> Task similarity metrics to assist Commanders and training developers with the development of Combined Army Training Strategies</li>
</ul>

This tool is <b>not intended to be prescriptive</b>, but rather is intended to be a tool to facilitate more efficient, effective, and intuitive access to training information.

<b> Steps for using Crosswalk Visualizer </b>

<ol>
<li> Use the <b>Unit Selection</b> drop down to select a unit type from the drop down lists </li>

<li> Use the <b>Task Selection</b> drop down to select tasks to serve as the "root" nodes for a crosswalk (prioritization) or similarity analysis </li>

<li> Use <b>Prioritization Metrics</b> to assess the payoff and complexity of tasks based on a 1-step, 1.5-step, or 2-step crosswalk depth </li>

<li> use <b>Similarity Metrics</b> to determine tasks that are closely related on the basis of shared individual tasks </li>
</ol>

Additional explanations of the various aspects of this tool are available in the documentation section. If you have questions or want to report issues, please contact donald.d.koban.mil@mail.mil.
